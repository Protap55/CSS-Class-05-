    <p class="class1">Three BNP-affiliated organisations -- Jubo Dal, Swechchasebak Dal, and Chhatra Dal â€“ began long march towards Agarlata in protest against what they said "Indian aggression".</p>

    <p class="class2">South Korea's former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who claimed responsibility for the president's failed attempt to place the country under martial law last week, has tried to take his own life, an official said.
    Authorities found him while making the attempt in his detention centre on Tuesday, Shin Yong-hae, the justice ministry's correctional agency chief, told lawmakers.</p>

        <p class="class3">The mood was festive, but the crowd was there for a serious cause  to get rid of the country's president. But his mea culpa did little to appease the public. As lawmakers began making their way to the national assembly, various protest rallies started up across Seoul. While a few were in support of the embattled president, most were calling on him to step down or to be impeached. With rock bands, large screens and crane cameras, South Korean protest rallies tend to resemble outdoor music festivals, and this one was no different. Throughout the afternoon, the crowd was entertained by jolly acapella tunes, sentimental folk songs, and protest anthems.</p>

    <p class="class4">On Saturday morning, four days after Yoon's abortive attempt to declare martial law, the president once again appeared on television. This time it was to say sorry to the nation, just hours before an impeachment vote.</p>
